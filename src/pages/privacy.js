            <p>Please read the following carefully to understand our views and practices
            regarding your personal data and how we will treat it.</p>



            <h3>INFORMATION COLLECTION</h3>

            <p>We may collect, store and use the following kinds of personal information:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Information that you provide to us for the purpose of subscribing to email notifications and/or newsletters</li>
                <li>Information about your computer and about your visits to and use of the site</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>SHARING OF PERSONAL DATA</h3>

            <p>We may disclose information about you to any of our employees, officers, agents,
            suppliers or sub-contractors insofar as is reasonably necessary for carrying out
            the purposes set out in this Privacy Policy. This may include allowing our
            suppliers and sub-contractors access to your personal information where we have
            “outsourced” functions. However, any use by such suppliers or sub-contractors
            will be strictly limited and conducted in accordance with our instructions (as
            "data processors" described in the Data Protection Act).</p>

            <p>In addition, we may disclose your personal information:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>To the extent that we are required to do so by law</li>
                <li>In connection with any legal proceedings or prospective legal proceedings</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Your personal data will not be passed to third parties without your permission,
            other than as set out in this policy.</p>


            <h3>HOW PERSONAL DATA IS USED BY COGNITANT</h3>

            <p>We may contact you about our services if you choose to sign up to receive
            notifications from us. You do have the right at any time to opt out of being
            contacted in this way.</p>


            <h3>SECURING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</h3>

            <p>Cognitant Group Ltd. has implemented the required technical and organisational security
            measures to prevent the loss, misuse or alteration of your personal information.
            For example, we will store all the personal information that you provide
            on secure (encrypted, password- and firewall-protected) servers and send it only over
            encrypted transmission links. While the internet is inherently insecure and
            we cannot guarantee the security of data sent across the internet, we will take
            all meaningful steps to ensure it's as secure as appropriately possible.</p>

            <h3>WHERE YOUR DATA IS STORED (LOCATIONS)</h3>

            <p>Except for the operations listed below, your data is kept exclusively within
            physically secure ISO-27001 compliant data-centers located within the European Union.</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Backups: we keep backups of all our data in our backup service provider's
                SOC 2 Type II certified and HIPAA compliant data-centers, hosted in the USA. The
                legal basis under the GDPR for this processing is specified by GDPR-compliant
                Model Clauses, a GDPR Data Processing Addendum and a standard Data Processor
                agreement, in line with the EU-US Privacy Shield agreement.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>RETAINING PERSONAL DATA</h3>

            <p>This Section sets out our data retention policies and procedures, which are designed
            to help ensure that we comply with our legal obligations in relation to the
            retention and deletion of personal information.</p>

            <p>Personal information that we process for any purpose or purposes shall not be
            kept for longer than is necessary for that purpose or those purposes.</p>

            <p>Notwithstanding the other provisions of this Section, we will retain documents
            (including electronic documents) containing personal data:</p>

                <li>to the extent that we are required to do so by law;</li>
                <li>if we believe that the documents may be relevant to any ongoing or prospective
                administrative or legal proceedings;</li>
                <li>to transfer to the purchaser (or prospective purchaser) of any business or asset that we are
                (or are contemplating) selling; and</li>
                <li>in order to establish, exercise or defend our legal rights (including providing
                information to others for the purposes of fraud prevention and reducing credit risk).</li>
            </ul>


            <h3>RIGHTS OF THE DATA SUBJECT</h3>

            processing of their personal data. If you want to exercise any of those rights,

            <p>You may instruct us to provide you with any personal information that we hold about you.
            Provision of such information will be subject to the supply of appropriate evidence of your identity.</p>

            <p>We may withhold such personal information to the extent permitted by law.</p>
